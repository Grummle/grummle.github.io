##ToDoMVC
So when I went looking for AngularFire (Firebase angular SDK) I ran smack into TodoMvc example using Firebase. Which is pretty much EXACTLY what I'm looking for.
Some copy and pasting and look at that I've got a working shopping list that'll sync between our iPhones. One issue it looks like shiat. The css from the todomvc app is conflicting with the CSS that I got as a template when setting up github pages. 

Start messing with CSS.
