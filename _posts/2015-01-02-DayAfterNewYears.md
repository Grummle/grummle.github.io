## Firmware roundup.
So we are trying to figure out if the drives that we have a legit drives or if we got screwed. I'm going with screwed at this point, but the drives are ent level SSD
so we only apparenlty got screwed gently. They just aren't Dell branded. Ok, lets get some firmware numbers.


PERC H710P
Driver Version	6.600.21.08
Storport Driver Version	6.3.9600.17090

BIOS
Manufacturer	Dell Inc.
Version	1.1.2
Release Date	03/08/2012

BMC/iDrac
iDRAC7	1.57.57 (Build 4)
Lifecycle Controller 2	1.4.2.12


##List Upload
Ok so after rebasing master into list upload branch I've got to make sure no one else (GG) was playing with the branch as I need to force it upstream. So that worked
out to be alot easier then I'd hoped. I apparently took my time when I did the rebase and it was suprising clean. Its pushed to master as GG requested so now he can play with it
and make fun of me.

##Interview Questions
Why do it yourself when you can farm it out! Dispatched a email to the team to see what they want to see asked.
